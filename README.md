# Go Booking App

Welcome to the Go Booking App project! This beginner-friendly project is designed to help you learn and practice various fundamental concepts of Go programming, including data types, variables, constants, formatted output, user input, pointers, scope rules, loops, if-else statements, switch statements, functions, packages, and goroutines.

## Project Description

This project is a simple cli booking application written in Go. It allows users to book the tickets for the conference. While the functionality is straightforward, the purpose is to give you hands-on experience with a range of core Go programming concepts.

## Learning Objectives

By working on this project, you will gain experience with the following Go programming concepts:

- Data Types: You'll work with different data types to manage booking information.

- Variables and Constants: Learn how to declare variables and constants for your application.

- Formatted Output: Use formatted output to display information to users.

- User Input: Capture user input to process reservations.

- Pointers: Understand how pointers work in Go for efficient memory management.

- Scope Rules: Explore variable scope within functions and package scope.

- Loops: Use loops to iterate through data or implement repetitive tasks.

- If-Else Statements: Implement conditional logic to handle user decisions.

- Switch Statements: Handle multiple conditions using switch statements.

- Functions: Define and call functions for code modularity and reusability.

- Packages: Organize your code into packages for better project structure.

- Goroutines: Experiment with concurrent programming using goroutines.
